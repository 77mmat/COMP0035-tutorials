# COMP0035 2025-26 Weekly practical activities

This repository contains the activities for the COMP0035 module for the academic year 2025-26.

## Instructions for using this repository

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine (e.g. in VS Code or PyCharm).
3. Each week, update the repository using the 'Sync fork' button in GitHub to check for changes, if it is out of date
   then select the 'Update branch' button.

## Activity instructions and code files

The `docs` folder contains the activity instructions for each week.

The `src` package contains any starter code for each week. You can also use this package to store your own code
that you create during the activities.

One solution to the week's activities will be added to the [tutor_solution repository](). Other solutions will be
possible, and some may be better than the solution offered, so don't feel
your code has to match the tutors code!

## Data

Most activities use paralympics data that was compiled from
the [IPC website](https://www.paralympic.org/paralympic-games).

The data is duplicated in some instances in `src/data` and in `src/starter/resources`. This is for teaching purposes for
an activity that explains different methods to import the data in the project depending on its location within or
outside the package's directory structure.
