# COMP0035 Activities 6: Requirements and wireframes

Theme: **Designing applications**

The next two sets of activities do not involve coding.

This week's activities introduce you to:

- techniques for documenting requirements
- wireframes

The activities are **not** exemplars for the coursework; since many of the examples are partial solutions only.

There are other techniques that can be used for this stage beyond the few covered here; students aiming for higher marks
are encouraged to read more widely for this topic and to choose an appropriate blend of methods to use. A few starter
guides are in the repository:

- [Persona](persona.md)
- [Problem statement](problem-statement.md)
- [Product vision](product-vision.md)
- [Use cases and use case diagram](use-cases.md)
