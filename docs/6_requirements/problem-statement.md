# Problem statements

This guide provides a general introduction to problem statements and how you might create one.

## What is a problem statement?

It defines the problem being addressed in a way that is clear and precise. It is generally quite short; a few sentences
or paragraphs.

Typically, a problem statement outlines the negative points of the current situation and explains why this matters.

Its aim is to guide the scope of the project. It also serves as a communication tool, helping to get explain the project
to others.

Typically, it does not describe the solution, only the problem.

## Examples of a problem statement

### [University hackathon](http://www.mituniversity.edu.in/mitpersonafest/assets/upload/files/Software_Hackathon_Problem_Statements.pdf?2018)

"Students in the university come from different environments. Every student has some strengths and weaknesses. Recommend
or suggest methods/ways to improve or work on their weaknesses. The input to the system can be students personal
information, background that he comes from, things in which he is good at etc. The recommendations should be in terms of
improvements required in communication skills, writing skills, technical skills, way of presentation etc."

“The end to end sales process takes between 5 and 10 days to complete, with an average of 8 days. This does not match
customer expectations against our competitors. In a recent survey customer satisfaction had fallen by 5 points in the
last quarter, which they directly attributed to speed of service. In the last month the speed of service problem has
lost us 20 customers, and an estimated loss in revenue of 20K.”

"Busy working professionals need an easy, time-efficient way to eat healthily because they often work long hours and
don’t have time to shop and meal prep."

## Approach to writing a problem statement

There is no single approach to writing a problem statement.

Typical steps would include:

1. Ask 'Who, What, Where, When, Why and How' questions e.g.
    - _What_ is the problem that needs to be solved?
    - _Why_ is it a problem?
    - _Where_ is the problem seen (location, product)?
    - _Who_ is affected by this problem (customers, businesses)?
    - _What_ is the outcome of the problem in terms of revenue, productivity, operations, or production?
    - _How_ are they affected? What are the symptoms?
    - _When_ does this problem occur? How often does the problem occur?
2. Write the problem statement.
3. Read the problem statement and consider:
    - Does it consider the problem from a customer or target user's perspective?
    - Does it focus on an existing problem?
    - Can you quantify the problem in any way?
4. Share it with others and ask for feedback

## Format

There is no single or specified format for writing a problem statement. If you find you prefer to work to a particular
structure then there are freely available examples such as the ones below.

### Example format 1: [ProProject Manager](https://www.proprojectmanager.com/problem-statement/)

Replace the suggestions in parentheses with your own words to express your company’s situation.

Problem: (_department or affected personnel_) are (_current situation with quantification, including timeframes_), (_
ramifications of the current situation_). This is a (_productivity, expense, liability_) issue and results in (_
decreased sales, wasted time, lowered productivity, lost revenue, increased expenses_). XYZ company is going to (_
examine our processes, determine the root causes through review, generate a business plan, implement a specific piece of
software_)
in order to (_reduce expenses, increase revenue, increase productivity, decrease liability_).

### Example format 2: [isixigma](https://www.isixsigma.com/new-to-six-sigma/getting-started/how-to-write-an-effective-problem-statement/)

**Gap**: Identify the gap (pain) that exists today.

**Timeframe, location and trend:** Describe when and where the problem was first observed and what kind of trend it is
following.

**Impact**: Quantify the gap (cost, time, quality, environmental, personal, etc.)

**Importance**: To the organization, the individual, etc. to better understand the urgency.

#### Example 3 [Medium Data Science blog](https://medium.com/@vinitasilaparasetty/guide-to-defining-problem-statements-baf52219ea5b)

The problem (_insert the problem as defined by the company_) has the impact (_insert the negative impacts/pain points of
the problem_) which affects (_insert the parties that are affected. It could be the business, the customers or a third
party._) so a good starting point would be (_insert the benefits of solving the problem_).
