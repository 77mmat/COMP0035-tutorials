# Week 4 Code quality: linting, docstrings, PEP8/257, use of functions

_*Theme: Working with code for applications*_

## Introduction

The activities this week focus on actions that can be taken to improve the quality of your code. That is, actions that
do not affect the functionality of the code, only how it is written and structured.

The activities centre around the concept writing 'clean code'. Code is considered clean if it can be understood easily
by yourself and other developers. Code that is easier to understand is easier to read, change, extend and maintain by
anyone (not just the author).

Robert Martin's book Clean Code describes practices that help a programmer to write clean code, these include:

- Follow standard conventions (style guides, syntax)
- Create expressive variable and function names
- Keep it simple, avoid complexity
- Write modular code and practice DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) in The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and Dave
  Thomas)
- Document your code

The activities this week concentrate practical steps you can take in your work that help to achieve this. 

Note that the quality of your code is considered throughout the coursework in this module and in COMP0034.

## Activities

The activities this week are shorter. Use remaining time to complete any outstanding activities from weeks 2 and 3.

This week's activities all contribute towards improving the structure and quality of the code, rather than the
functionality. Code quality is always considered in the grading of code in COMP0035 and COMP0034 coursework.

1. [Docstring](4-01-docstrings.md)
2. [Linting and auto-formatting](4-02-linting.md)
