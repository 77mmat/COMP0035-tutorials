# Week 5 coding activities: Working with classes and databases

This topic relates to coursework 2. It is not needed for coursework 1.

This week introduces concepts related to classes and how these may be used when working with data from databases. You
should work through all the activities as the concepts are related and knowledge should be progressively built through
the activities.

The concepts are important. Learning all syntax is not!

Each type of class discussed in activities 1, 2, 3 and 5 vary in their syntax which can seem confusing. You will
ultimately mostly use SQLModel with an SQLite database in COMP0034 and COMP0035, so do not be concerned at trying to 
learn other syntax.
