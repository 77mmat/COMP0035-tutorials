# Week 3 coding activities

_*Themes: Designing applications*_ & _*Using Python to work with data*_

## Setup

### Pre-requisites

1. Have forked the COMP0035 tutorials repository, cloned it to your computer, and set up a project with a virtual
   environment within your IDE (VS Code or PyCharm).
2. Updated the forked repo in your GitHub account [see](/docs/2_pandas/2-0-instructions.md)

### New: Enable mermaid support

The activities use a tool called [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/entityRelationshipDiagram.html) to define and
display database diagrams. To view the diagrams in the markdown you need to have this tool installed.

For PyCharm, Go to PyCharm | Settings | Plugins then search for
the [Mermaid plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20146-mermaid).

For VS Code, go to Code | Settings | Extensions and find
the [Mermaid chart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/MermaidChart).
