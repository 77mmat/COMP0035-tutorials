# Activity 2.16: Further practice (optional)

1. Apply the principles to the 'medal_standings' dataframe, e.g.:

    - check for missing values
    - check for issues with categorical data
    - remove columns you don't think you will need
    - check and change datatypes

2. Data preparation with pandas is a popular topic, if you search you can find many tutorials freely available.

3. Use Copilot or chatGPT and ask for advice on using particular pandas functions.

4. Look at Kaggle. There are lots of data sets and often examples of data preparation others have carried out. For
   example look at
   the [120 year of Olympic history](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
   This is a larger dataset than the one used in this tutorial and there are many code examples from others that use
   this dataset (some better than others!).

## Apply the knowledge to your coursework project

As a third year module, the coursework is not meant to be a series of instructions to follow. However, to get you
started this week here are some suggestions of what to do:

- Install pandas and openpyxl in the virtual environment of your coursework project in your IDE.
- Use pandas to read the data into a dataframe.
- Write code to describe the dataframe contents e.g. size, column names, datatypes, statistics.
- Write code to explore the data in more detail e.g. consider missing values, incorrect data types, unique values in
  columns, plot ranges of values and investigate outliers

Do some extra research. There are many tutorials publicly available that focus on data preparation with pandas. Try to
find examples that do more that has been covered in this tutorial to expand your knowledge.
